      <h2 id="dpa">Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act No. 10173 – Data Privacy Act of 2012</h2>
      <h3>Purpose and Policy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The IRR enforces the Data Privacy Act of 2012 to protect the right to privacy while supporting the free flow of information for innovation and development. It adopts international standards and ensures accountability of both government and private entities in handling personal data.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Scope and Coverage</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The rules apply to all persons and entities processing personal data in or outside the Philippines if it involves Filipino citizens or residents. Exemptions apply for public information, journalism, research, and lawful government activities.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>National Privacy Commission (NPC)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The NPC is an independent body that implements the Act through rule-making, compliance monitoring, investigations, issuance of guidelines, complaint handling, international coordination, and public education.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Data Privacy Principles</h3>
      <p>Processing must follow the principles of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Transparency – informing data subjects of the purpose and use of their data</li>
        <li>Legitimate Purpose – processing for lawful, declared, and specific purposes</li>
        <li>Proportionality – collection limited to what is necessary</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Lawful</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Personal data may be processed with consent or when necessary for contracts, legal obligations, vital interests, emergencies, government mandates, or legitimate interests. Sensitive and privileged information require stricter safeguards.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Security</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Organizations must apply organizational, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Data Protection Officers (DPOs), privacy policies, and risk assessments are required.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Rights of Data Subjects</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Individuals have the rights to: be informed, object to processing, access, rectify, erase or block data, data portability, and transmissibility of rights—subject to lawful limitations.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Data Breach Notification</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Entities must notify the NPC and affected individuals of data breaches within prescribed timeframes, detailing the nature and remedial actions. Delays are allowed only under strict conditions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Outsourcing and Subcontracting</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Personal information controllers remain accountable for third-party processing, which must be governed by contracts ensuring data protection.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Registration and Compliance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Entities handling large-scale or sensitive data must register with the NPC and submit reports on breaches, security measures, and automated processing.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Accountability and Penalties</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Violations such as unauthorized processing, negligence, improper disposal, and malicious disclosure carry fines and imprisonment. Public officers face additional sanctions, including disqualification.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Miscellaneous Provisions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The IRR covers appeals, compliance periods, interpretation, appropriations, separability, and effectivity. It took effect 15 days after publication.</li>
      </ul>
