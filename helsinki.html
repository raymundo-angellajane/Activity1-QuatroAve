      <h2 id="helsinki">WMA Declaration of Helsinki – Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Participants</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The Declaration of Helsinki, issued by the World Medical Association (WMA), sets forth fundamental ethical principles for conducting medical research involving human participants, including the use of identifiable data and biological materials. While directed primarily at physicians, it applies broadly to all individuals and institutions engaged in medical research.</p>
      <h3>Core Ethical Principles</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Respect for Persons</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Uphold the dignity, autonomy, and rights of all participants.</li>
            <li>Ensure informed, voluntary, and documented consent.</li>
            <li>Provide special safeguards for individuals unable to give informed consent.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Beneficence and Non-Maleficence</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Participant welfare must take precedence over scientific or societal interests.</li>
            <li>Risks must be justified by potential benefits and continuously monitored.</li>
            <li>Research must avoid unnecessary harm.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Justice</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensure fair access to participation and research benefits.</li>
            <li>Avoid worsening health inequalities through unjust inclusion or exclusion.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Scientific Integrity and Transparency</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Research must be scientifically valid and ethically designed.</li>
            <li>Results, whether positive, negative, or inconclusive, must be publicly disclosed.</li>
            <li>All studies must be registered in a public database prior to participant recruitment.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Key Operational Guidelines</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Research Protocols and Ethics Review:</strong> All studies must undergo independent ethics review, considering local context and transparency.</li>
        <li><strong>Vulnerable Populations:</strong> Inclusion is justified only when exclusion would worsen disparities, with safeguards in place.</li>
        <li><strong>Informed Consent:</strong> Consent must be free, informed, and documented; assent and dissent of minors or incapacitated individuals must be respected.</li>
        <li><strong>Use of Placebos:</strong> Permitted only when no proven intervention exists or when necessary for methodology without causing serious harm.</li>
        <li><strong>Post-Trial Provisions:</strong> Participants benefiting from interventions must receive continued access after the study.</li>
        <li><strong>Data and Privacy:</strong> Confidentiality must be maintained; secondary use requires separate approval.</li>
        <li><strong>Unproven Interventions:</strong> May be used only when no proven options exist, and trials are not feasible.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Duties of Physicians and Researchers</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Uphold participants’ life, health, dignity, privacy, and rights.</li>
        <li>Ensure ethical conduct and scientific competence.</li>
        <li>Avoid compromising patient care when combining research and clinical practice.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Environmental Responsibility</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Research must minimize environmental impact and support sustainability.</li>
      </ul>
