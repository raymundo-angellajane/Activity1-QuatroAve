      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>On July 12, 1974, the National Research Act (Public Law 93-348) was enacted, establishing the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. One of the Commission’s main responsibilities was to identify fundamental ethical principles for conducting research involving human subjects and to develop guidelines to ensure research aligns with those principles.</p>

      <h3>Scope of Review</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Distinction between research and standard medical practice.</li>
        <li>Methods for assessing risks and benefits in human-subject research.</li>
        <li>Guidelines for selecting research participants.</li>
        <li>Application of informed consent across contexts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Development</h3>
      <p>The Belmont Report originated from a focused four-day meeting in February 1976 at the Belmont Conference Center. It was refined through nearly four years of monthly discussions and was eventually published in the Federal Register for public access. Supporting analyses were made available through DHEW Publications No. (OS) 78-0013 and No. (OS) 78-0014.</p>

      <h3>Nature of the Report</h3>
      <p>Unlike most Commission reports, the Belmont Report does not propose specific policy recommendations. Instead, it was intended to be adopted in full as a statement of departmental policy, with public comments invited for consideration.</p>
    
      <h3>Core Ethical Principles</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Respect for Persons</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Uphold the dignity, autonomy, and rights of all participants.</li>
            <li>Ensure informed, voluntary, and documented consent.</li>
            <li>Provide special safeguards for individuals unable to give informed consent.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Beneficence and Non-Maleficence</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Participant welfare must take precedence over scientific or societal interests.</li>
            <li>Risks must be justified by potential benefits and continuously monitored.</li>
            <li>Research must avoid unnecessary harm.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Justice</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensure fair access to participation and research benefits.</li>
            <li>Avoid worsening health inequalities through unjust inclusion or exclusion.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
